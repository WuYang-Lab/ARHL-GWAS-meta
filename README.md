# Multi-ancestry meta-analysis for Age-related hearing loss

This reposity contains the main analysis code to perform cross-ancestry meta-analysis as part of the manuscript "**Multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of age-related hearing loss in 1.5 million individuals identifies 140 risk loci and reveals key cellular mechanisms**"

Scripts are listed by the order in the methods section of the manuscript:
- 1: Cross-ancestry GWAS meta analysis
- 2: Genetic architecture analysis
- 3: Shared genetic analysis
- 4: Genome wide fine mapping
- 5: Multi-omics QTL analysis (SMR)
- 6: Spatial enrichment of heritability
- 7: Cell type specific enrichment

The reposity will be updated soon after peer review.
